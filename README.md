Description

This project generates a graph with n vertices, ensuring a clique and a stable set of size k. The graph is represented as an adjacency matrix.

Main.java - Runs the program.

Graph.java - Creates the graph.

GraphUtils.java - Computes properties.

Command line 
java -cp out com.mycompany.homework_1.Main 10 4

Output: Number of edges (m): 6

Maximum degree (?): 3 //unicode did not work for delta

Minimum degree (Î´): 0

Degree sum check: true

Adjacency Matrix:
